- **Office Hours:** Wednesday, 3–5 PM. Try to make it to my listed office hours _first_. If you have a conflict with that time, direct message me on Slack with a few alternative times that work for you. Appointments are generally for discussing grades and course progress; for technical questions / assignment questions please use the public Discord server so that everyone can benefit from the discussion. Finally, I am always excited to take appointments with students interested in doing research / projects with me (independent study, thesis advising/reading, etc.); log on and say hi!

## Course Description
IMGD 5100 will discuss interaction through the lens of *Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction* (often shortened to TEI), considering issues of embodiment in virtual environments, alternative physical interfaces, and human-computer interaction in the digital arts, games, and crafts. Assignments in the class will reach across a variety of different mediums to explore user interaction: text-only, audio-only, and integrated multimodal approaches. Additonal goals include studying fundamental human-computer interaction principles, practicing critique, and exposure to a variety of technologies for interaction and user experience design.

The course will supplemented with guest lectures from both within and outside the WPI community, including experts in haptics, novel human-computer interaction in dance, tangible programming languages, immersive audio, and experience design for embodied installations. 

## Keep up with course announcements and participate on the Discord
Make sure you join the Discord server (see link at top of syllabus). Important announcements will be made via Discord, so make sure you're logging on regularly. This is also the best place to ask questions... and hopefully answer when you have some expertise to share. Please stay on top of course communications.

## Grades
50% [Weekly readings / design sprints](https://imgd5100-21spring.github.io/assignments)  
50% Project(s)

Given the current pandemic, as far as I'm concerned grades are really there to let you know my impression of how you're doing in the class. If you turn in all your assignments and participate in class, you will get an A. If you turn in most of your assignments but miss one or two, you will still get an A. Late work is accepted for design/development assignments, however, turning in such assignments late will often mean you miss out in chances for in-class critique. *Please complete the weekly readings*, as class discussion will be both confusing and boring without doing so. That said, I understand that readings might be particuluarly time consuming for non-native English speakers; please reach out to me if you have concerns about completing the weekly readings as the semester advances. 

## Attendance
Don't miss class! Unless you're sick, or have a family member that's sick, or some other extenuating circumstance. Class will provide critique sessions, a variety of guest lectures, and other opportunities that can't easily be replicated viewing a video recording. That said, I will do my best to record all class sessions and post the recordings.
