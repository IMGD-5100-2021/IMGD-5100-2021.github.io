# AR / VR Design Sprint

For this assignment, you can choose to make *either* an AR or a VR project (don't do both unless your super motivated). AR will require the use of your phone (or potentially a hololens if you have access to one), VR will require the use of a platform like Google Cardboard, or access to more specialized hardware if you have it.

Projects can be realized in any platform you choose, but I encourage using AFrame or Unity. We will use class time to critique this sprint, so be prepared to work with other students / the instructor to make your project accessible to people. Note that specialized hardware won't be avaiable for these critiques, so be sure to think about documentation if you're using a device like the Vive / Hololens etc.

## VR
In this design sprint, we will be **exploring virtual reality to consider what it will be like when computation can transport us to another place.** Transport someone to a real location, inside a game, among abstract art... whatever you think would be interesting, immersive, and compelling. You may work in teams for this assignment.

A couple of quick pointers before you start:
- **Be sure to articulate your design goal / objective ASAP.** Without an objective for your design, much of your process will be unguided. If your goal is to provide a sense of awe or provoke reflection or make someone feel like they are truly in another physical place... any of that is fine. The key is that you articulate your goal and make design decisions that align with that objective.
- **Consider what will make your design feel immersive.** This is your primary challenge, and it's worth thinking beyond visual channels. How could audio enhance your design? Should you add other forms of interaction besides keyboard / cardboard button / mouse?
- **Careful with interaction.** Because of time and hardware limitations, consider what input mechanisms you may even have available to you before getting too deep into the development.

## AR
In this design sprint, you will make arbitrary user-occupied spaces *creepy*. This can be interpreted however you see fit. What types of virtual objects can you place in a space that create unease? Discomfort? Can you use sound in some way to emphasize this effect? What types of interaction might be *disturbing*? How can users explore the worlds you augment?

### Deliverables
- A short demo video, hosted online. Documentation of your assignment, including a brief description of what you made, how it was received during critique, and what you would change if you continued to work on it. Include the link to your video in your documentation, which should be a .pdf.
- Your AR/VR experience should be publicly accessible so that others can visit it or download it. **Include this link in your design doc.** If you're using AFrame, it's fine if this is a link from [glitch](https://glitch.com/) (which is probably the easiest place to develop your work).
